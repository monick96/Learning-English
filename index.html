        <h2> The crown by M.R. James</h2>
            <h3> <strong>Summary</strong></h3>
            <p>The Crown is a ghost story. There is a magic crown under
            the ground in Seaburgh. It protects England – and William
            Agers protects the crown.</p>
            
            <p></p>Paxton is on holiday in Seaburgh and finds the crown.</p>
            <p>One night he takes it and then sees a shadow behind him.</p>
           <p>He runs quickly back to the hotel. Is the shadow William
            Agers? But Paxton knows that William Agers is dead!
            Paxton is afraid. He wants to put the crown back in the
            ground. Two men at his hotel help him put the crown in
            the ground again.</p>
            <p>The next day Paxton’s friends follow him to the beach.</p>
            <p>They see Paxton’s footprints in the sand – and some
            strange, long footprints too. They follow the footprints
            and find Paxton dead. The ghost of William Agers
            protected the crown – and it still protects the crown
            today.</p>    
            <h3>About the author</h3>
            <p> M. R. James was born in England in 1862 and died in 1936.</p>
            <p></p>He loved old books, history and language. He studied
            and taught these at Cambridge University. His ghost and
            horror stories are famous because they are clever and
            frightening. His great knowledge of history gives his stories
            a lot of detail and the places and characters seem real.</p>
            <h3> <strong>The original text</strong></h3>
            <p>The Crown is a classic ghost story, whose original title is A
            Warning to the Curious. It deals with the finding of one of
            the three crowns of East Anglia, holy relics buried along
            the Anglian coast to protect the realm against invasion. In
            his introduction to the Collected Ghost Stories, M. R. James
            explains that Seaburgh is Aldeburgh in Suffolk.</p>

            <h2> Robinson Crusoe by  Daniel Defoe</h2>
             <h3> <strong>Summary</strong></h3>
            <p>Robinson Crusoe is a very long book, but the novel can, more or less, 
            be broken down into three major movements.</p>
           <h4>Part I: Before the Island</h4>
            <p>Before landing on the island, Crusoe's father wants him to be a good, 
            middle-class guy. Crusoe, who wants nothing more than to travel around in a ship, 
            is definitely not into this idea. He struggles against the authority of both his 
            father and God and decides to thumb his nose at both by going adventuring on the 
            sea instead.</p>
        
            <h4>Part II: Life on the Island</h4>
            
            <p>This portion of the novel is dedicated to Crusoe's time alone on the island. 
                He builds three main structures: his initial shelter, 
                his country home on the opposite side of the island, 
                and his guns and ammo fort in the woods. 
                He spends his time planting corn, barley, and rice. 
                He learns to make bread. He builds furniture, weaves baskets, 
                and makes pots. Crusoe also raises goats and tends to his little 
                animal family of cats, dogs, and a parrot. Most importantly, though, 
                Crusoe becomes stronger in his religious faith, eventually submitting 
                to the authority of God. 
                He devotes himself to much religious reflection and prayer.</p>
            
            <h4>Part III: Escape from the Island</h4>
           
            <p>In final section of the book, Crusoe sees a footprint on the shore one day and learns 
                that he's actually not alone on the island. There are also (gasp!) cannibals. Crusoe 
                struggles with the question of whether or not he should take revenge on them. Eventually, 
                he meets with Friday, a native man whom he is able to rescue from the cannibals. Crusoe 
                teaches Friday English and converts him to Christianity. The two become like father and 
                son (more or less). Friday and Crusoe also rescue a Spaniard and Friday's father from a 
                different group of cannibals.</p></br>
           
            <p>Eventually, an English longboat full of sailors lands on the island. Crusoe learns that the 
                men have mutinied against their captain. After Crusoe helps restore order to the ship, the 
                men and captain pledge allegiance to Crusoe and agree to take him home. Crusoe then returns 
                to Europe with Friday, where he comes into a great deal of money from his sugar plantations. 
                Crusoe gets married and eventually revisits the island in his late years. The novel ends with 
                promise of more adventures for him in the sequel.</p></br>

                Mike Morrison writes about the play for the newspaper.

        <h3> <strong>Summary</strong></h3>
        <p>The Woman in Black is a ghost story by Susan Hill, in which Arthur Kipps relates his haunting experiences at Eel Marsh House.</p>
        <p>The tale begins on Christmas Eve, when Arthur's step-children invite him to tell a ghost story. Arthur is too disturbed by his memories to share his story aloud, so he writes it down.</p>
        <p>In his story, a young Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor, is sent to settle the affairs of Alice Drablow. He sees a woman dressed in black at her funeral, though apparently no one else does. At Eel Marsh House, a house beyond a causeway, Arthur is haunted by noises and sightings of the woman. Eventually a local man, Sam Daily, reveals the full story of how Alice Drablow's sister, Jennet, haunts the house. He explains that a child dies each time the woman in black is seen. At the end of the story, Arthur sees the woman in black again and his wife and son die in a terrible accident.</p>
        <p>The Woman in Black is a ghost story about heartbreak and revenge.</p>
